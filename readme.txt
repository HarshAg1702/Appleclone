Visit "homeapple.html" file to start your journey through Apple's web evolution.
This website is made using HTML 5 and CSS 3.
On the homepage of the website, the navbar allows the user to traverse through different webpages.
Various functionalities for different options have been provided : 
1.  Simply clicking the Apple logo, takes the user back to the home page of the website.
    Note : The Apple logo can also be seen in the taskbar of the web browser.
2.  Upon hovering the mouse pointer over the navigation bar, the navbar changes from an 'aesthetic' semi-transparent black to a solid black.
3.  Upon further hovering, specifically over the contents or the text on the navigation bar, transitioning submenus can be observed for :
	 i)   Mac
	 ii)  iPad
	 iii) iPhone
4.  Detailed web-pages other than that of the home page, have been put in place for : 
	 i)   MacBook Pro (macbookair.html)
	 ii)  MacBook Air (macbookpro.html)
	 iii) Vintage Apple (vintage.html)
5.  On the home page, the learn more option beneath the MacBook Air Showcase, can be clicked, subsequently taking the user to the web-page of the said item.
6.  On the MacBook Air or the MacBook Pro pages, the navigation bar allows the user to navigate between the said three pages.
7.  On clicking the 'Vintage Apple' option on the navigation bar, the user is taken back in time, 30th June 2007, to be exact, a day after Apple's first iPhone,
    a revolutionary gamechanger in the smartphone market, was launched.
8.  Upon hovering over the options in this vintage navigation bar, a detailed web-page for 'Store' has been put in place (store.html).
    Note : The Apple logo in the taskbar of the web browser has been changed to the one Apple used back then.
9.  Upon clicking the said option, the user is taken to the details of the first-ever iPhone. The Apple logo in the navigation bar takes the user back to the
    home page of the vintage Apple website. Information about the vintage website was gathered through limited available screenshots of users who posted it
    on the internet. This visualisation of the website comes close to the one Apple originally put up in 2007.
10. The Modern Apple option takes the user back to the home page of the modern Apple website.
